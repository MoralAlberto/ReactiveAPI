#ReactiveAPI
ReactiveAPI is an API module that works with [Reactive Cocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) and [ObjectMapper](https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper). The architecture is split in different logic parts: the managers, the network stuff, and the parser model.

##Requirements
- iOS 8.0+
- Xcode 7.0

##Installation
Run the following command in the root directory of your project

```bash
$ carthage update
```

##Example
ReactiveAPI works with the Stackoverflow API. The main purpose is request the 30 most recent updated questions. 

All the logic between layers is separated, for instance: **network**, **parser**, **models** and **managers**.

The first step is call a method to get all the questions:

```swift
API.questions()
   .observe({ items in
      if let items = items.value {
         for item in items {
            print("\(item.title!)")
         }
      }
})
```

Then, the API calls the forward method in **Questions** Class with all the necessary information (URL and Request).

**Questions' manager**, this class manage the data received from the request, and then it parses to a correct model and sends the object within the signal, then, the observer (the view controller) will receive all the questions because it's subscribed to receive a list of **items**.  

###Parser Manager
The best part of this method are Generics. We can parse any class with this method, reusable code! 

```swift
static func parse<T: Mappable>(data: NSData, toClass: T.Type) -> T {
   let parsedObject: AnyObject?
   do {
      parsedObject = try NSJSONSerialization.JSONObjectWithData(data, options: NSJSONReadingOptions.AllowFragments)
   } catch _ as NSError {
      parsedObject = nil
   }
   let result = Mapper<T>().map(parsedObject)
   return result!
}
```

###Network Manager
Creates the network request, this class also is reusable with any server request.

```swift
class func dataWithRequest(request: NSURLRequest) -> SignalProducer<NSData, NSError> {
   return NSURLSession.sharedSession().rac_dataWithRequest(request)
          .retry(2)
          .map { data, URLResponse in
             return data
          }
          .flatMapError { error in
             print("Network error ocurred: \(error)")
             return SignalProducer.empty
          }
}
```
